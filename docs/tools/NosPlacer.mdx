# NosPlacer

NosPlacer is a **map editor specifically designed for NosTale**, allowing users to manipulate .NOS files related to the game's maps.
It provides functionality to add, remove, duplicate, and modify models within the currently opened map.
However, it operates in a way that does not directly modify the original .NOS files;
instead, it allows for the export of maps to a binary file format that can later be imported using other tools like [OnexExplorer](./OnexExplorer).
